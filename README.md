# Sorting-algorithm-one-singal-time
I've got a couple of different data structures and array of numbers a string of characters and a linked list where each node contains a number. So the goal for this project is only to write out a sorting algorithm one single time and we're going to make that sorting Elgar algorithm work equally well for all of these very different data structures.
